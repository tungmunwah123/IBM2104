                    <p>“When I meet someone with spina bifida I want them to know that anything is possible."</p>
					<p>This story is part of Health’s #RealLifeStrong series, where we are celebrating women who represent strength, resilience, and grace.

Misty Diaz was born with spina bifida, but it wasn't until she was in her 20s that she met another person with the condition. “I was going around thinking I was the only one who had this disability," she says. Now at 30, the L.A.-based athlete travels around the country running races—and inspiring others with (and without) disabilities.

Spina bifida is a birth defect that affects the spine and spinal cord. In Diaz’s case, it damaged her L5 vertebrae. “It affected my walking, my growth, and my bladder,” she says. As a result, Diaz stands at just 4’4”, weighs 80 pounds, and uses crutches to get around. That hasn't stopped her from completing 5Ks, 10Ks, half-marathons, and even extreme obstacle courses. 

Two years ago, Diaz became the first adaptive athlete ever to finish the Red Bull 400, a 400-meter sprint up the ski jump at Utah’s Olympic Park in Park City. When she first heard about the race, in a video on Facebook, she knew right away she had to try it. Diaz began training her upper body with lots of rowing and lat pulldowns, so she could make it up the near-vertical incline on crutches. She reached the top in 35 minutes. In 2018, she shaved 10 whole minutes off her time. </p>
